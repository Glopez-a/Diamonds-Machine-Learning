## Introduction

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the price of diamonds based on their various features. By leveraging the power of GradientBoost algorithm and performing grid search for hyperparameter tuning, we strive to achieve the best possible performance.

The project consists of several stages, including exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset, data preprocessing to handle missing values and normalize features, feature engineering to create new meaningful features, label encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical representations, and training the GradientBoost model using grid search for hyperparameter optimization.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Diamond Dataset, which includes various attributes of diamonds such as carat weight, cut quality, color, clarity, dimensions, and price. The dataset is not included in this repository, but it can be obtained from a reliable source such as Kaggle or a diamond data provider.
